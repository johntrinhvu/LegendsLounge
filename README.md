# Legends Lounge
## A League of Legends Blogpost Forum
### Created by: John Vu

A blogpost forum specifically for League of Legends players, where players can post their opinions about the game, discuss strategies for different roles, and ask questions about the game itself. I took inspiration styling from a couple of websites, such as Reddit and Mobalytics.

## Technologies Used

- MongoDB: A document-based database used to store and manage data.
- Express: A web application framework for Node.js used for building the server-side API.
- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime used for building the server-side application.

## Planning materials

## What I want to work on in the future (Icebox features)

I would like to have a functioning search bar, functioning like and dislike buttons that are stored within the database, as well as making a new schema for comments and replies for comments underneath posts. Also, adding a League of Legends API for the future would not be bad, to capture real time data.
