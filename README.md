## A League of Legends Blogpost Forum
### Created by: John Vu

A blogpost forum specifically for League of Legends players, where players can post their opinions about the game, discuss strategies for different roles, and ask questions about the game itself. I took inspiration styling from a couple of websites, such as Reddit and Mobalytics.

## Technologies Used

- MongoDB: A document-based database used to store and manage data.
- Express: A web application framework for Node.js used for building the server-side API.
- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

## Key Features

- User Registration and Authentication: Users can create an account and log in using JWT authentication.

- CRUD Operations: Users can create, read, update, and delete their own blogposts.
